## Where things stand

Core loop works: move (WASD/arrows), gather (branches/rocks free; trees/boulders
need the right tool kind equipped), craft (T), manage inventory/hotbar (Tab,
1-9, scroll wheel), equip tools via the hotbar. Recipe discovery is gated by
"have you picked up the ingredients" + skill level; unlocks announce themselves
via a toast + persistent event log (bottom-right, collapsible). Placeable
items (currently just the campfire) skip the backpack entirely — crafting one
enters a placement mode instead (see below).

### Just finished: Placement mode for build/placeable items

Plan file: `.claude/plans/ancient-painting-petal.md`.

Items flagged `placeable: true` in `Items.ts` (currently just `campfire`) no
longer land in the backpack when crafted. Instead:

- The crafting menu's button reads **"Place"** instead of "Craft" for these
  recipes (`isPlaceableRecipe()` in `Recipes.ts`, checked in `CraftingMenu.ts`).
  Clicking it closes the crafting menu and enters **placement mode**
  (`MainScene.startPlacement`) — no cost is deducted yet.
- A semi-transparent ghost preview follows the cursor, clamped to
  `PLACEMENT_RADIUS = REACH * 1.25` (80px) of the player (recomputed live each
  frame, so walking repositions the radius). A small hint —
  `[LMB] Place <item>   [RMB] Cancel` — shows under the top-left controls
  line (`placementHintText`, 12px, `(12, 30)` — deliberately NOT the shared
  bottom-right gather-prompt text, and deliberately not overlapping the
  hotbar or the `[T] Craft` tab).
- **LMB** (`attemptPlaceObject`) deducts the recipe cost only at that moment,
  spawns a plain world image at the ghost's position, and **re-arms**
  placement mode immediately so the next one can be placed without reopening
  the crafting menu — this loop is the "ask to place another" behavior,
  expressed as the persisting prompt rather than a separate confirm dialog.
  Running out of materials mid-loop auto-cancels with an event-log message.
- **RMB**, **Escape**, or **Tab** cancel placement mode outright — free,
  since nothing is spent until a successful LMB.
- A same-click double-fire bug (Phaser fires both the "Place" button's own
  `pointerdown` and the scene-wide generic `pointerdown` for one click, which
  was placing the object right where "Place" was clicked) is fixed via a
  one-shot `suppressNextPointerdown` flag consumed by the scene's global
  pointerdown handler.
- No loose-world-drop system was needed for this — since materials are only
  spent on a successful LMB, a cancelled placement has nothing to destroy.
  That concept is still deferred to Milestone 3 (or to whenever destroying
  *already-placed* build pieces becomes a feature).
- Placed objects are currently just visual (`this.add.image`, no physics
  body, no interaction) — intentionally minimal; a real placed-object entity
  can come later alongside the destroy-for-pieces feature.

Verified via `preview_eval` (radius clamping, cost-only-on-LMB, free RMB
cancel, Escape/Tab cancelling instead of opening menus, the double-click fix
via simulated real Phaser pointer events, and clicking "Place" through the
actual crafting-menu UI). Type-check clean, no console errors.

### Previously: Milestone 1 of the inventory-overhaul plan, plus a UI polish pass

Plan file: `.claude/plans/bug-i-can-drag-twinkling-engelbart.md` (3 milestones;
M1 done, M2/M3 not started).

**M1** replaced the old derived-list item model (`Inventory` counts + `ownedTools`
Set + `craftedItemCounts` Map) with a single unified slot-based model:

- **`src/systems/ItemContainer.ts`** (new) — fixed-size array of `{key, count}`
  stacks. `add`/`hasRoomFor`/`count`/`removeCount`/`findAssignable`, plus the
  free function `moveSlot(src, si, dst, di)` that merges-or-swaps. This one
  primitive backs every drag, rearrange, and hotbar assignment.
- **Backpack** (`MainScene.backpack`) and **Hotbar** (`Hotbar.container`) are
  each an `ItemContainer`. Resources (wood/stone/leather) are now regular
  stackable items living in the grid (max 99), not a separate counter.
- **`Items.ts`** — every item def now carries `maxStack` (99, or 1 for
  tools/weapons) and `hotbarable` (false for shishkabob/campfire).
- Drag is scene-owned (`MainScene.beginItemDrag/resolveItemDrag`), not
  per-widget — this is what lets items move backpack<->hotbar and rearrange
  within either. Right-click quick-moves via `quickMoveItem`.
- Mouse wheel cycles the hotbar 1-9 (wraps both directions) unless the pointer
  is over the event log, which scrolls its own history instead
  (`EventLogUI.isPointerOver`).

This fixed both reported bugs (item duplicating into multiple slots on
drag/right-click; crafting a 2nd tool eating resources with no result) as a
side effect of giving every item a single home slot instead of a derived
count.

**Then a follow-up UI polish session** cleaned up rough edges left by M1:

- Removed the top-left `Wood/Stone/Tool` HUD text (redundant once items live
  visibly in the grid/hotbar) and moved the "Move: WASD..." controls line up
  to `(12, 10)` now that nothing sits above it.
- **`src/ui/Tooltip.ts`** (new) — extracted the item-info popup (name,
  description, stats) that `InventoryMenu` already had into a shared class
  with two placement modes: `"right"` (flips left near the screen edge — used
  by the backpack grid) and `"above"` (opens upward, centered — used by the
  hotbar, which sits at the very bottom of the screen). `HotbarUI` now shows
  the same hover tooltip the backpack grid does.
- **`InventoryMenu`** reworked into a horizontal layout — backpack grid grown
  from 5x4 (20 slots) to **6x6 (36 slots)** on the left, with the 3x3
  equipment grid repositioned to its right (was stacked above it), using the
  vertical space freed up by that move.
- **Crafting menu** recipe rows now show the item's icon next to its name
  (`[icon] Stone Axe`). `outputKey(recipe)` (tool/itemId -> item key) moved
  from `MainScene.ts` into `Recipes.ts` as a shared export so both
  `MainScene` and `CraftingMenu` use one implementation.
- **Recipe-unlock toasts** redesigned: previously a center-screen toast shared
  with level-up/info messages; now recipe unlocks get their own small
  icon+text card that slides in from the right edge, lands in a stack
  top-right (below the `[T] Craft` button, clear of the bottom-right event
  log), holds, then fades. Multiple unlocks queue and stagger in one at a
  time (~200ms apart) instead of popping in simultaneously. Level-up/info
  toasts are unchanged (still center-screen via `EventLogUI.showToast`).

**Verified via `preview_eval` + `preview_screenshot`** — direct scene-method
calls to inspect state precisely (container/text object positions, contents,
tween state via an in-page `await new Promise(setTimeout...)` before
inspecting), plus visual screenshots for layout confirmation. Type-check
clean throughout. No console errors.

### Up next

Back to the inventory-overhaul roadmap: **Milestone 2** (resource node
health/multi-hit, tool damage, swing animation + node decay/shake per hit),
then **Milestone 3** (loose world drops with stack consolidation + magnet
auto-pickup — plan file `.claude/plans/bug-i-can-drag-twinkling-engelbart.md`).

Per `CLAUDE.md` convention (one milestone/feature per session), M2 should
start in a fresh chat session rather than continuing this one.

### Known rough edges / deferred (see plan's "Out of scope" section)

Carry weight, tool durability, craft-quantity selector, stacking exceptions
beyond durability — all intentionally deferred, not forgotten. Placed
objects (campfire) have no collision/overlap checks and can't be destroyed
yet — deferred until a destroy-for-pieces feature exists, at which point the
loose-world-drop system (Milestone 3) will be needed for real.
